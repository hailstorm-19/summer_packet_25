# Goal-Keeping 3

## Kicking Drills

A vast amount of field hockey goalkeeping is dependent on kicking the ball. Below are some drills to work on your kicking and foot coordination.

**Play some soccer! Focus on using the inside of the foot.**

**Hacky sack. This may seem silly but really does help improve your foot-eye coordination.**

*If you have goalie equipment:*
- **Kicking for power:**
  - Line up balls in front of the cage.
  - Rapid fire style, rip through reps down the line, kicking the balls into the goal with the same foot.
  - Focus on power. Use the inside of the foot, crossing over your opposite foot.
  - Repeat for opposite foot.
- **Kicking for accuracy:**
  - Set up targets (a cone, a small goal, etc.) to your left and right.
  - Either from a dead ball, or from a buddy shooting at your feet, clear to the right or left, aiming for your targets out wide.
