# Elimination Skills

All you need is a stick, a ball, and an obstacle.

Set up your obstacle -- this can be a set of cones, a water bottle, a backpack... anything!

Attack your obstacle, perform one of the following eliminations, seal off your "defender" (the obstacle) and continue traveling in your attack path for a few steps before resetting for the next rep.
- pull right
- pull left
- spin right
- spin left
- lift
- pop
- V dodge right (attack left side, dropstep back right, accelerate right past defender)
- V dodge left (attack right side, dropstep back left, accelerate left past defender)
- C dodge (fake a pull overtop of the ball)
