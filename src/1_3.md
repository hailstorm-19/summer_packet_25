# Week 1 / Day 3

## 1000yds
This is Week 1, so use this as your baseline. Work on efficient turns and driving through strong strides on your acceleration off the line. This workout is meant to be done on a field, but could also be done a treadmill. If doing this workout on a field as intended, it is suggested to place your water bottle at the opposite goal line, so you can take a sip before walking back. Your next sprint should begin as soon as the walk finishes.
