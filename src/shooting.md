# Shooting

Set up an obstacle (a couple cones, or a stick -- anything, really!) just outside the circle's edge.

Attack the obstacle, do an elimination, and rip a quick shot *as soon as you get inside the circle*.

Challenge yourself! Attempt shots on your backhand; play around with various ball placement. The more comfortable you are in getting a shot off with any ball positioning, the more threatening you are.

This is not a highly technical drill -- it's just meant to be fun and get you in the habit of taking quick shots. Be dynamic with high energy and have fun with it!

If you have a friend with you, make this a pass into the top of the circle, then a quick shot.
