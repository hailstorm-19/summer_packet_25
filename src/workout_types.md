# Types of Workouts

## Strength
Stronger bodies are more stable, less prone to injury, more explosive on the field, and stronger on the ball. Strength workouts will vary; some will require no equipment, while some call for some simple gym equipment (dumbbells, box/bench, bands, etc). Look ahead at all of the workouts and pre-plan to match your accessibility to equipment. For example, if you know you'll be out of town and away from any gym equipment, swap in no-equipment workouts for those days. Within the individual workouts, adjust your weight selection as necessary to be appropriately challenged.

## Endurance
Within one full field hockey game, you'll run many miles, so let's prepare for that! Endurance workouts will start out small. Keep track of your performance and try to build on your endurance results throughout the summer. 

## Speed
Speed wins 50/50 balls. Speed workouts will train our first step so that we can be quick off the line. Keep in mind that your strength workouts will also help build the power needed for a quick change of pace.

## Agility
Agility workouts will coordinate with speed workouts. Let's strive for tight footwork and quick change in direction.
