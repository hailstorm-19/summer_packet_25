# Week 8 / Day 1

## 24-min Interval Run
This interval-style running will help strengthen our endurance and lower recovery time. This workout is designed to be done on a trail/sidewalk/road. You will increase pace every 8min, so pace yourself at the beginning. Try your hardest not to walk. If using a treadmill, walk speed should be around 3.0-3.3mph. Jog speed should be between 5-7mph. Sprint speed should be at least 8mph. It's Week 8, and tryouts are right around the corner! This is the time to pull back off of the intensity so that you enter the week of tryouts with optimal energy levels. Fuel well and hydrate.
