# Week 8 / Day 3

## Stop-Starts, Agility Boxes & Footwork
It's nearing the end of Week 8, and tryouts are right around the corner! This is the time to pull back off of the intensity so that you enter the week of tryouts with optimal energy levels. Fuel well and hydrate.

Work on tight footwork and change of direction. This workout is meant to be done on a field. An agility box is simply a square that you'll make for yourself. You will travel around the perimeter of the square doing short movements. They are meant to be quick bursts of speed, staying tight around the corners of your agility box.
