# Dynamic Receptions

You'll need a partner for these!

Passing with your partner, practice the following receptions (google any of these or ask Coach if you need help!):
- let the ball cross your body, continuing the path of the pass; try this on both strong side and reverse side
- brush reception; let the ball cross your body and quickly "brushing" it across your body with a snappy lateral pull
- 3D; turn your stick into a ramp, lifting the ball off the ground and traveling with it on the move
- toward the ball; receive on the move toward your partner -- think of this as an interception-type reception
