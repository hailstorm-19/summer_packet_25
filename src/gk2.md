## Hand-Eye Coordination Drills

Below are various ideas for working on hand-eye coordination.

**Wall Ball:**
- bounce a tennis ball against a wall, catching it with one hand
- for an added challenge, add another ball. Have a tennis ball in each hand; alternate hands, or try both hands at the same time.
- too easy? get closer to the wall

**No Wall? Just use the ground:**
- bounce a tennis ball or lacrosse ball, catching it with one hand
- for an added challenge, add another ball. Have a tennis/lacrosse ball in each hand; alternate hands, or try both hands at the same time.
- too easy? bounce the ball harder

**Ball Drop:**
- Find a friend! Have them hold a ball in each hand with their arms straight out in front of them.
- Hold your hands out parallel with theirs.
- Without you knowing which one it'll be, they will drop either ball and you try to catch it before it hits the ground.

**Juggling**
