# Goal-Keeping 1

## Lateral Movement & Quick Feet

Set up 4 cones:
- 1 cone 5yd to your left
- 1 cone 5yd straight in front of you
- 1 cone 5yd to your right
- 1 cone at your feet -- this is your center starting spot

The cones should be in the shape of a 'T'.

**10x superset:**
- side shuffle to left cone & back to center starting spot
- sprint to top cone, breaking down your feet at the cone and backpedal back to center starting spot
- side shuffle to right cone & back to center starting spot
- 30s rest

**4x10/10 jump turns (10 each side)** (*bodyweight squat; explode up, turning 90 degrees; hop back to original direction on the way back down into your squat. Try to turn the hips as sharply as possible*)

**4x30sec cone figure 8's**:
- set up 2 cones, 1 yd apart
- in low athletic stance, move laterally with quick feet through the two cones in a figure 8 for 30sec
