# Week 2 / Day 1

## 25-min Interval Run
This interval-style running will help strengthen our endurance and lower recovery time. This workout is designed to be done on a field. If using a treadmill, walk speed should be around 3.0-3.3mph. Jog speed should be between 5-7mph. Sprint speed should be at least 8mph. If using a treadmill, estimate distances for each interval based on the instructions below.
