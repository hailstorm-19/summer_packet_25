# Defensive Skills

*All you need is a stick and a ball! These are simple, short drills you can do by yourself to keep your defensive game sharp.*

**Jabs**
- Strong, athletic stance.
- With an open grip, quickly jab the ball far out in front of you.
- Quickly return your hands so that your stick is protecting your feet.
- Keeping your feet moving the whole entire, travel 25yds repeating these jabs.
- Rest 1min. Repeat 2x.

**Footwork**

Travel backwards for a total of 25yds.
- Maintaining an athletic stance and your stick protecting your feet, dropstep and side shuffle on a negative diagonal for 5yds.
- Swing hips open to dropstep and side shuffle facing the opposite way for another 5yds.
- Continue flipping back and forth until you've gone 25yds.
- Rest 30sec. Repeat 2x.

**Have a partner? Work on stopping balls that are not receivable.**
- Take turns hitting *hard* hits at one another.
- Focus on solidly trapping the ball. Soft hands; left (top) hand forward, angling your stick forward to trap the ball.
- Focus on receiving the ball in *front* of your body, as opposed to the side.
- Repeat with bouncy push passes.
