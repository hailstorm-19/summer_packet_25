# Week 5 / Day 3

## 10yd Sprints
We're working on speed! DRIVE through your first 3 steps, then lengthen your stride. If you're able, have someone time you; try to beat your times as you progress.

Notes:
- falling start:
  - at your starting line, stand with feet together and legs straight; lean forward onto toes until you fall forward; your first step to catch yourself is the start of your sprint
- kneeling start:
  - Kneel on one knee perpendicular to the direction you are running. *The knee that is down is the direction you running*. This is your starting position. Let's call the knee that is UP your "post" leg. To begin your sprint, drive through your "post" leg as you stand and turn, landing the first step of your sprint on the leg that was down. You'll do 3 reps facing one way to work one leg; then 3 reps on the other knee facing the opposite way to work the other leg. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/cCtnoWZzkx4) if you need a demo.
- prone start:
  - lie face down and push your self up from the ground into your sprint; try to keep your weight leaning forward and drive through the knees as you come up out of the prone position
