# Rebounds

You will need a stick and as many field hockey balls as you have.

Spread out all the balls you have in an arc around the goal, about 5yds from the goal.

Rapid fire, get all the balls into the cage.
- Try not to go in a straight line of balls -- bounce to different areas along your arc around the goal.
- We don't need big backswings here; we want speed and accuracy.
- Aim high and/or corners.

This is not a highly technical drill -- it's just meant to be fun and get you in the habit of finishing scrappy rebounds. Be dynamic with high energy and have fun with it!
