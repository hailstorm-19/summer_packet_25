# Stick Handling

You will just need a stick and a ball.

#### Stationary:
From a low, strong, athletic stance:
- tiny touches (mini pulls) out in front of you (really far out in front)
- work the ball in these tiny touches around your body for 1min bouts; get comfortable with all different sorts of ball positioning

From a low, strong, athletic stance:
- wide pulls from left to right -- make these snappy!
- work on your pulls as two touches: a pull and a catch
- transition to one touch -- fast and crisp!

From a low, strong, athletic stance:
- start with the ball in front of your left foot
- pull it across to your right side
- pull the ball back into a dropstep to your right
- swing your hips back forward and pull the ball back up in front of your right foot
- pull the ball back across to your left -- the original starting position
- repeat 15x
- repeat from a starting position in front of your right foot, with a left pull and a left dropstep

From a low, strong, athletic stance:
- find a line and put one foot on either side of the line
- do a small pull to the right side of the line
- carry the ball in a small, controlled lift over to the left side of the line
- repeat 15x
- repeat for the other side -- small pull to the left and controlled carry to the right

#### On the Move:
- find a line and put one foot on either side of the line
- with the ball on the line, dribble along the line for 15yds in the following variations:
  - keeping the stick on the ball the entire time (no taps!)
  - keeping the stick on the ball the entire time and swaying the body from one side of the line ot the other
  - tiny, controlled lifts along the line the whole 15yds
  - carry the whole 15yds (keep the ball on the stick and try not to let it drop -- stay low, keep the ball below knee-level)
