# Introduction

Welcome to the 2025 Summer Workout Packet! This packet takes you through the next 7 weeks and will be a variety of strength, endurance, speed, and agility training. Please be diligent with these workouts; your efforts (or lack thereof) will be noticed. Yet, be patient with yourself! These workouts are not designed to be perfected; rather, they are meant to frame your fitness standards and keep us on track for a competitive season.

### What do I do with this packet?
While the packet is very easy to digitally navigate, I also highly recommend printing it out if possible. Bring it to the gym, bring it to the fields where you train, pack it in your bag on summer vacation, and mark it up with your performance and notes. Keep in mind, there are some links embedded within the packet that will only be useful to you in digital form. Ultimately, use it however is best for you. On that note, also feel free to move the workouts around if necessary to fit your needs. While it is currently structured to serve you best in your training regimen, doing it differently is better than not doing it at all.

### What will I need?
Equipment and space needs will vary depending on workout. If you find yourself without the proper tools (weights, field space, etc), you're encouraged to make adjustments. Flex these workouts to challenge yourself as much as possible even with equipment limitations.

### Warmups and cooldowns
Workout-specific dynamic warmups are provided in the next section of this packet. Please do the appropriate warmup for the type of workout you are doing. Cooldowns are not as thoroughly included in this packet; please make sure you are stretching very well after each workout.

### Field Hockey Drills
In this packet, you'll also find a section of field hockey drills. If you aren't playing much hockey this summer, please find the time to sprinkle in some of these drills in addition to the workouts.

### Terminology
- Rep = one repetition of an exercise
- Set = a collection of reps
In some workouts, you will see the word "superset". It will typically have a list ("block") of exercises, and each of those exercises has a certain number of reps per set. In a superset, you complete 1 set of each exercise in the exercise block. After completing the last exercise set, you return to the top of the exercise block and do another set of each exercise in the block. Repeat this until you've completed the number of sets prescribed for the superset.
```
Example:
3x superset
- 10x push-ups
- 10x sit-ups

In this example, you would complete 1 set of 10 push-ups, 
then 1 set of 10 sit-ups -- that's 1 set. 
Repeat the pattern two more times for a 
total of 3 alternating sets push-ups and sit-ups.
```
