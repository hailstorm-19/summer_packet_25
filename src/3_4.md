## FULL BODY LIFT

[Strength Warmup](./strength_warmup.md)

**4x superset:**
- 12x rdl (barbell or dumbbell)
- 8x push-ups

**3x12 seated row** (dumbbell alternative: bent over row)

**overhead press drop set. 3x superset:** (*see note below*)
- 10x heavy
- 20x light

**finisher!! 3x superset:**
- 20x lateral raise

Note: A drop set is when you start with a heavy weight and drop to a lighter weight -- all within the same set. So, in the overhead press exercise block, you are doing 3 sets of 10 heavy and 20 light reps.
